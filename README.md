<!-- about app -->

## About the App

After participating in several hackathons, I am attending my first online and as part of the process I needed to put the project here, so I hope you enjoy it 😊

The challenge was to improve the experience of participants and mentors during the hackathon and having participated in so many, what hurt me the most was mentoring. Every hour a group of mentors with great knowledge came to my team and I had told them how things are going and get great feedback, then another group of mentors came again to my team and I had to say everything again, creating a cycle of precarious mentoring 😰

That's why we created hackatrack, a platform that connects everyone in the hackathon. Each team can update their status sharing good or bad news with the mentors, with that, every group can receive precise feedback based on their status. The mentors can also update team status, giving even more information so others mentorships take less time and are more assertive 🤩

Hackatrack app is ready for launch! We are waiting for store review and as soon as we are on we will share the link with you guys.

We are happy to receive [feedback](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hackatrack) and answer any Qs about the project and its future! 🙂

## Our mission

Our mission is to reduce stress and improve productivity in hackathons with an status update platform in which all the teams share their progress with all the mentors, so they can give precise mentoring at the right moment, keeping everyone in the same page
